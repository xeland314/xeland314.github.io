        💡 Project Origin and Vibe Coding
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        This project was conceived and developed using the
        <strong>Vibe Coding with Firebase Studio</strong> methodology, an innovative
        approach that combines AI-assisted code generation with an integrated
        development environment. The central idea of time estimation,
        particularly the weighted average formula for tasks, was inspired by a
        video from Luisina of TodoCode, using the same calculation logic she
        presents in her Excel spreadsheet.

        Development with Vibe Coding and Firebase Studio
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Vibe Coding with Firebase Studio allows for seamless interaction with a
        large language model (LLM) to generate and refactor code, which
        significantly speeds up the development process. However, this
        methodology presents its own challenges:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Constant Review of Changes:</strong> It is crucial to continuously
          monitor the code generated by the AI, as it can introduce unexpected or
          suboptimal solutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Correction of Typing Errors:</strong> Despite using TypeScript,
          the AI sometimes generates code with typing errors that require manual
          correction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tracking AI Changes:</strong> Keeping a clear record of which
          parts of the code were generated by the AI and which were manually
          modified is essential for version control and debugging.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Small Manual Corrections:</strong> Fine-tuning and manual
          adjustments are often required to adapt the generated code to the
          specific business logic or project conventions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><code>npm build</code> and Deployment Errors:</strong> The final
          integration and compilation can present challenges, requiring
          additional debugging to resolve build errors and ensure a successful
          deployment.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">✨ Main Features</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>AI-Powered Requirements Generation:</strong> Generates software
          requirements documents based on user input, incorporating best
          practices for functional, non-functional, security, and deployment
          requirements. The LLM decides which details to include or omit based
          on the prompt.

            class="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto my-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg"
          />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Module Management:</strong> Allows users to create, name, and
          organize individual project modules to structure the estimation
          process.
          <img
            src="/images/codecraft_estimator_preview2.png"
            alt="Module management"
            class="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto my-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg"
          />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Manual Task Entry:</strong> Enables manual entry of tasks
          within each module, including optimistic, pessimistic, and most
          likely time estimates. All estimates are stored as Decimal types and
          can be entered in minutes, hours, or days.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Automated Time Calculation:</strong> Calculates the weighted
          average time for each task using the formula:
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>$$t_p$$ Pessimistic Time (highest estimate)</li>
            <li>$$t_m$$ Most Likely Time (most realistic estimate)</li>
            <li>$$t_o$$ Optimistic Time (lowest estimate)</li>
          </ul>
          $$(t_p + 4 \times t_m + t_o) / 6$$ Displays this estimate on the screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Risk and Complexity Adjustments:</strong> Provides a section
          to enter potential project risks (with their associated time
          estimate) and an overall effort multiplier for considerations like
          security or deployment complexity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Time to Cost Conversion:</strong> Dynamically converts the
          total estimated time to a project cost based on a user-definable
          hourly rate. Changes are reflected reactively when any of the time
          estimates are adjusted.

          />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI-Powered Task Augmentation:</strong> Allows the user to
          enter a prompt to add more tasks to the current module and adjust
          task times. The LLM decides if the task suggestions can improve
          project delivery.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Estimate Export:</strong> Allows exporting time and cost
          estimates to a JSON file for later use or for sharing with other
          stakeholders.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Statistics and graphs:</strong> Generates visual project
          statistics, including bar and line charts showing the distribution of
          estimated time per module.

            src="/images/codecraft_estimator_preview4.png"

        ✅ Recommendations for Future Implementations with Vibe Coding
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        To maximize efficiency and quality in future projects using Vibe
        Coding, the following practices are suggested:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Define a Clear Architecture Upfront:</strong> Before starting
          Vibe Coding, having a well-defined high-level architecture
          (components, data flow, responsibilities) can better guide the AI and
          reduce the need for major refactoring.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintain a Detailed <code>changelog.md</code>:</strong> In
          addition to version control with Git, a dedicated
          <code>changelog.md</code> file can serve as a manual record of
          significant changes made by the AI and human interventions, facilitating
          debugging and understanding the project's history.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Establish Robust Tests from the Start:</strong> Implementing
          unit and integration tests early in the development cycle helps to
          quickly identify and correct errors introduced by the AI, ensuring
          code consistency and reliability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Iterate in Small Steps:</strong> Making incremental changes and
          testing them frequently can help isolate problems and better
          understand how the AI interprets and generates code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Understand the LLM's Capabilities and Limitations:</strong>
          Familiarizing yourself with the specific strengths and weaknesses of
          the LLM used can help formulate more effective prompts and anticipate
          potential problem areas.
